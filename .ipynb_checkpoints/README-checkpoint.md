# ðŸ“Š Jharkhand Disability Data Analysis (Census 2011)

This project explores the **prevalence of disability across various districts and age groups** in the Indian state of **Jharkhand**, using data from the **2011 Census**. The motivation is from a documentary highlighting the impact of uranium mining in **Jadugora village (Purbi Singhbhum district)** on local tribal populations.

## Motivation

Inspired by this short documentary on Jadugora:
[Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xsc_m10YX8)
After that I came across an article highlighting issues faced by local people in Jadugora

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
- **NumPy** â€“ numeric operations
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Data Sources

- **Census 2011 â€“ Disability by Age, Area, and District(C4920), populatation(C4114)**
- CSVs (included in the repository)

---

## Analysis Performed

- Percentage of disabled population in each district
- Rural vs Total disability comparison
- Age-wise disability distribution
- Specific comparison between:
  - **Purbi Singhbhum (Jadugora uranium mining site)**
  - **Godda district (highest reported disability)**

---

## Visualizations

- **Bar plots** for disability percentage by district  
- **Line plots** showing age-wise disability trends  
- **Highlighting rural data** where health access is limited  
- **Anomalies and possible data underreporting** in certain districts

---

## Key Findings

- Godda has the **highest rural disability percentage**
- Surprisingly, Purbi Singhbhum (site of mining impact) reports **lower-than-expected disability** â€” possibly due to reporting bias
- Rural areas show **consistently higher disability rates**, especially in older age groups
